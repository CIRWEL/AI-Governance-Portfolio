# Real-World Applications

**AI Governance Systems in Practice**

---

## About Autonomous Governance

**Key Distinction:** CIRWEL's governance systems are **fully autonomous** - agents govern themselves through peer review and thermodynamic monitoring. No human oversight is required for governance decisions. However, some applications may add human oversight layers for safety or regulatory compliance.

**UNITARES Governance Framework:**
- **Autonomous peer review** - Agents review each other through dialectic protocol
- **Self-healing recovery** - Paused agents recover autonomously via peer review
- **Real-time monitoring** - Continuous thermodynamic state tracking
- **No human required** - Governance decisions are fully automated

**Application Layers:**
Some applications add human oversight on top of autonomous governance for:
- Regulatory compliance (FDA, SEC requirements)
- Safety-critical systems (defense, medical)
- Legal accountability (audit trails for human review)
