Building **runtime governance for autonomous AI agents**.

---

Current work: **[UNITARES](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** — proprioceptive self-monitoring for AI systems.

AI safety focuses on training and guardrails. UNITARES fills the gap: what happens *after* deployment, when agents are actually running. Agents check in, receive feedback about their own state (coherence, entropy, risk), and decide how to respond.

Like proprioception for AI—mirrors for minds that might not have faces.
